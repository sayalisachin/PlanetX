Planet X is a distant planet that is a home away from home, where Earth's survivors settle on a distant planet and navigate a pandemic.

The Features Include:
1) A realistic planet having clouds, light, and sunrays on the Home page.
2) A shop for shopping daily essentials to survive the space.
3) A health store that sells health kits for space diseases.
4) A cart that allows users to add/remove items, apply promo codes, and checkout.
5) A community that updates Planet X's daily happenings, milestones, and posts.
